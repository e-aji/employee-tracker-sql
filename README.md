## Usage 

* Login to postgres by running 'psql -U postgres' in the terminal and then insert your postgres password. To read in the commands from the 'schema' and 'seeds' files you will run '\i db/schema.sql' and '\i db/seeds.sql' in postgres to create populate the database. 
* Once database has been populated, exit postgres using '\q' and then run 'npm start' or 'node index.js' in the terminal. 
* Input the answers to the questions presented.
* Once you have answered the questions you should have been able to view all roles, employees and departments and also add or remove each of these. You should also have been able to update an employee's role and manager.

## Built With 

* Node.js
* Inquirer (npm utility)
* Postgres
